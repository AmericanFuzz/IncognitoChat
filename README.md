# IncognitoChat
 Chat anonymously, anywhere, anywhen, *as long as both of yall using app at same time*


 Funny Story:

 I had to visciously fight with app store connect to have this app published, and it still became banned, because they realized people could send stuff anonymously like hate messages and p***ography. I understood these were bad flaws, but I still refused to make it not incognito. So... Enjoy your freedom!!!ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¦
